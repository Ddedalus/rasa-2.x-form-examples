#  Rasa Form Examples

This repository contains a collection of tutorials that will help you understand forms. Each example is self contained and is part of a series of videos on our youtube channel. Note that all the demos here are built with Rasa 2.2 in mind. 

## Installation 

To run all the examples here you'll need to install Rasa, preferably in a virtualenv in the root directory. 

```
python -m pip install rasa==2.2
```
